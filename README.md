## By default, if you sort GitHub repositories by name, the ordering follows **lexicographical order**. This means:

1. Repositories are sorted alphabetically (A to Z).
2. Capital letters are considered before lowercase letters (e.g., `Alpha` comes before `alpha`).
3. Numbers and special characters precede letters:
   - Numeric names come first in ascending order (e.g., `1Repo` comes before `2Repo`).
   - Special characters are sorted based on their ASCII values, often preceding alphanumeric characters (e.g., `-Repo` comes before `ARepo`).

Here’s an example of the default ordering:
1. `!Repo`
2. `123Repo`
3. `Alpha`
4. `alpha`
5. `beta`

GitHub’s web interface allows you to toggle between ascending or descending order, but the default (when sorted by name) is **ascending lexicographical order**.
